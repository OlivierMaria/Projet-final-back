# See https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files for more about ignoring files.

# If you find yourself ignoring temporary files generated by your text editor

# or operating system, you probably want to add a global ignore instead:

# git config --global core.excludesfile '~/.gitignore_global'

# Ignore bundler config.

/.bundle

# Ignore all logfiles and tempfiles.

/log/_
/tmp/_
!/log/.keep
!/tmp/.keep

# Ignore pidfiles, but keep the directory.

/tmp/pids/
!/tmp/pids/
!/tmp/pids/.keep

# Ignore uploaded files in development.

/storage/_
!/storage/.keep
/tmp/storage/_
!/tmp/storage/
!/tmp/storage/.keep

# Ignore master key for decrypting credentials and more.
